    <div class="center">
        <p style="width: 50%">Geography allows us to learn about our climate and the impact that we have on it. Although global warming occurs naturarlly,
            humans are beginning to create a large impact on the climate.
            <br><br>
            Firstly, let's talk about how global warming is caused.
            <br><br>
            Global warming is caused when carbon dioxide goes into the atmosphere and traps heat. However, humans have been producing many items with 
            fossil fules, oils and gasses which we burn. Then, it becomes carbon dioxide and ends up in the atmosphere, tapping more heat.
            <br><br>
            The consequences of global warming can already be seen. Parts of the antarctic are beginning to melt and animals are suffering. We need to stop this.
