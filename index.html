    <h3><u>Key Reasons</u></h3>

        <div class="col card1">
            <h1>Knowledge About The Climate & Global Warming</h1>
            <p>Geography allows us to learn about our climate and the impact that we have on it. Although global warming occurs naturarlly,
                humans are beginning to create a large impact on the climate.

        <div class="col card2">
            <h1>Employment</h1>
            <p>Geography is also a career people can follow. This gives people jobs which leads onto my second point, employment.
                People need jobs, and currently, many people are unemployed, meaning they lack money which causes them to not be able to have any essential
                items, such as shelter, food or water. A career in Geography can help these people and give them the essentials they require. 
            </p>

        <div class="col card1">
            <h1>Survival Skills</h1>
            <p>Surprisingly, Geography can also give you survival skills. Knowing the signs of a tsunami, a storm or an earthquake may help you and others evacuate
                the place you are in before the event comes. Also, if you are lost with a map, you can use your Geography skills to help you
                learn about the place you are stuck in and leave it.

        <div class="col card1">
            <h1>Reading Skills</h1>
                <p>
                    Geography also includes reading. However, this reading is not only limited to maps. Geography requires you to learn & analyse data, read reports
                    and read first-hand accounts.
                </p>

        <div class="col card2">
            <h1>Understanding of the Earth</h1>
            <p>Being able to understand the planet you're on is important. Geopgraphy enables you to learn about the Earth and it's physcial features.
                Some physical and man-made features of the Earth include:
                <ul>
                    <li>Volcanoes</li>
                    <li>Mountains</li>
                    <li>Roads</li>
                    <li>Oceans</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="col card1">
            <h1>Understanding of Current Events</h1>
            <p>Finally, Geography gives you the ability to understand the news and current events. For example, news about wars requires you to understand
                the land in which the war is taking place to be able to understand the news. In other words, understanding the geographical features of countries
                allows you to learn about them and take in more information, allowing you to understand the world we live in in more depth.
